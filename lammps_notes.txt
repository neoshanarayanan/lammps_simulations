/usr/local/Cellar/lammps/2019-06-05 is location of LAMMPS executable

downloaded source code onto /Users/neosha/ and it is in mylammps
have yet to build from source code
must compile lammps as shared-library - am getting error

to do:
work through lammps examples on website (start here: https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/LAMMPS_Help)
continue looking into building lammps from source code instead of using executable

finish Isabelle's slides
