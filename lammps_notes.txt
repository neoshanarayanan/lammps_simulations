Before lunch: put extruder on table and winder on the floor. Going to see how/if this works
Face of nozzle gets dirty really easily

What am I going to do now?
- clean out all the blue dye - just extrude all of it. 
- measure out PLA pellets and put in 2% dye (measure with scale)
- try to extrude that

LITERATURE REVIEW

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4786850/ in-nozzle impregnation of PLA with carbon fiber and jute fibers for 3D printer filament and printing

https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b02062?src=recsys graphite loading of PLA composite for printing batteries
- OF NOTE: created 3D printable filament (conventional FDM printer) with graphite loaded PLA
- page 7486: extruding temperature was fixed 15 degrees C higher than the melting temp of the composite film deduced from DSC analysis - prior to each extrusion, the extruder was cleaned with neat PLA
- used tape casting to create PLA-graphite composite for

What I could put in my slides:
What I've been working
- what worked and didn't with the extruder
	- temperature tests
	- why extruder isn't working

- future ideas: what to do with plastic/biomass composites
	- mechanical mixing of graphite and PLA - already been done
	- carbon fiber
	- chitin - according to previous studies it does not change the properties of the material
	- graphene

- ordered the new extruder
- effect of drying filament

Concerns with using graphite: magnetic mixing might be needed: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391010000042#sec3.1
	- impurities

MUST DRY ALL COMPONENTS INCLUDING GRAPHITE - find the way to do this/protocol

Things to do next week
- familiarize self with LAMMPS?
	- download
	- look at C++ syntax

- learn tensile testing machine
- learn 3D printer
- ask Zhao about wood blender
- familiarize self with filabot manual
- make sure that there are not other things to do
- download/learn autoCAD


NOTES: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452321618300611 (mechanical testing of 3D printed polymers)
	- figure out what dimensions tensile test machine required
	- try 8x8x12mm

parameters manipulated:
	- layer thickness
	- infill type/amount (cross, diamond, honeycomb, strong/hollow/solid)

researchers then used some instrument to determine the cause of the fracture/see the fracture pattern

found out the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) in MPa

7.1.2019
send Zhao email asking for MD polymer system

CHARMM force field config file:
http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml


commands for "namd basics":

package require psfgen
topology top_all27_prot_lipid.inp
pdbalias residue HIS HSE
pdbalias atom ILE CD1 CD
segment U {pdb ubqp.pdb}
coordpdb ubqp.pdb U
guesscoord
writepdb ubq.pdb
writepsf ubq.psf

To do today:
run an NAMD simulation/get through tutorial


Problem I am having: I am not able to convert pdb into psf which is what NAMD needs. 
This is because I am not able to open the pgn file I saved with all my commands using the Terminal command line that was given to me in the tutorial. It says "file or directory not found". I think this could be because VMD is installed in a weird place. 

Ideas:

use command line to move VMD installation to applications folder which is local to user neosha

install VMD again

watch video on converting to psf (indian guy)


7.3.2019

terminal command to convert pdb to psf from pgn config file:  /Users/neosha/Desktop/VMD\ 1.9.4.app/Contents/vmd/vmd_MACOSXX86 -dispdev text -e ubq.pgn

Questions: 
NAMD tutorial page 18: what is the scaled1-4?? why are we specifying it this way?

7.8.2019
Results of phone call with Markus

use LAMMPS instead of NAMD
ask around the group for help/example simulations I can run
get familiar with LAMMPS this week
look for papers with PLA/graphite
look for emails 


/usr/local/Cellar/lammps/2019-06-0 is the location of LAMMPS executable

Things I'd like to do
Get LAMMPS support with Python - need to build LAMMPS manually
see if you can get movie support to generate movies

cloned LAMMPS into home folder: ~/ (same level where Desktop, Dropbox are)

to do:

work through LAMMPS examples on website
create git repository
see if you can build into Python


7.8.2019

/usr/local/Cellar/lammps/2019-06-05 is location of LAMMPS executable

downloaded source code onto /Users/neosha/ and it is in mylammps
have yet to build from source code
must compile lammps as shared-library - am getting error

to do:
work through lammps examples on website (start here: https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/LAMMPS_Help)
continue looking into building lammps from source code instead of using executable

finish Isabelle's slides

https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/dump_image.html how to create videos



7.9.2019

did:
ran these commands to build lammps with Eesha's help

downloaded source code from github
make serial from source code/src
make yes-molecule etc. (see eesha’s notes)
make yes-all if you want everything installed
after enabling the package you have to do “make” again
download openmpi 4.0.1 from website and put into Applications/src (just click on in it in file system to unzip the tar gz file)
configured: ./configure --prefix=”/Applications/src/.openmpi”
make
make mpi

We have not been able to install lmp_mpi but lmp_serial is built properly
Isabelle suggested to use Abaqus instead of LAMMPS


USING LAMMPS WITH PYTHON:
go to ~/mylammps/src

make lmp_serial mode=shlib (to make the lmp_serial machine a shared library to share with Python)


https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Python_mpi.html tried to install MPI using PyPar but since LAMMPS MPI is not built, it did not work
