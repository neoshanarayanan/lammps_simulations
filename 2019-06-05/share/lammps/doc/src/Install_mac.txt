Download an executable for Mac :h3

LAMMPS can be downloaded, built, and configured for OS X on a Mac with
"Homebrew"_homebrew.  Only four of the LAMMPS packages are unavailable
at this time because of additional needs not yet met: KIM, GPU,
USER-INTEL, USER-ATC.

After installing Homebrew, you can install LAMMPS on your system with
the following commands:

% brew tap homebrew/science
% brew install lammps              # serial version
% brew install lammps --with-mpi   # mpi support :pre

This will install the executable "lammps", a python module named
"lammps", and additional resources with all the standard packages.  To
get the location of the additional resources type this:

% brew info lammps :pre

This command also tells you additional installation options available.
The user-packages are available as options, just install them like
this example for the USER-OMP package:

% brew install lammps --enable-user-omp :pre

It is usually best to install LAMMPS with the most up to date source
files, which can be done with the "--HEAD" option:

% brew install lammps --HEAD :pre

To re-install the LAMMPS HEAD, run this command occasionally (make sure
to use the desired options).

% brew install --force lammps --HEAD $\{options\} :pre

Once LAMMPS is installed, you can test the installation with the
Lennard-Jones benchmark file:

% brew test lammps -v :pre

If you have problems with the installation you can post issues to
"this link"_homebrew.

Thanks to Derek Thomas (derekt at cello.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp) for setting
up the Homebrew capability.
